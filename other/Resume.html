<h3>Objective:</h3>
<p>
  I love technology.
  I think it's the perfect intersection of art and science;
  using math and logic to expand the universe with new ideas and creativity.
  Computer science has influenced nearly every aspect of our lives.
  From exploring the depths of space, to sharing important memories.
  It has given us the tools to create and to learn.
  For these reasons, I've dedicated myself to understanding this science.

    <h2>Fraxl</h2>
    <h2><small>Personal Project</small></h2>
    <p>
      Automatic caching and concurrency for data sources in Haskell.
      Similar to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/Haxl">Haxl</a>,
      which Facebook developed for their spam filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Accomplishments:</strong>
      Used knowledge in category theory and concurrency to simplify
      the creation, optimization, and testing of data sources.
      Will be presenting this at Compose Conference Melbourne later this year.

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>
  I enjoy playing Magic: The Gathering.
  It's a creative game of strategy,
  and it admits some really cool automated analysis.
  I also spend a lot of time reading about abstract mathematics as hobby.
  Math provides a strong understanding of lots of things in the universe,
  and I enjoy seeing how that applies to other aspects of my life.
