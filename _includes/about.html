<p>
  I started programming in 2010 and haven't stopped learning.
  I've picked up a multitude of skills along the way.
  Although I'm most experienced with Java and web development, I'm also very
  familiar with functional programming and languages like JavaScript and Haskell.
  I have plenty of personal interests in programming,
  such as concurrency, programming language theory, and category theory.
