<p>
  I started programming in 2010 and haven't stopped learning.
  I've picked up a multitude of skills along the way.
  I'm extremely familiar with functional languages like Haskell and JavaScript,
  and I'm highly experienced with object oriented languages like Java and Swift.
  I have plenty of personal interests in programming,
  such as concurrency, data science, and category theory.
